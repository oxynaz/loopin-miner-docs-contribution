# LooPIN Token Distribution

Each day, 100,000 LooPIN tokens are created. Here’s how they’re split:  
- **10%** (10,000 tokens) is set aside for the team and locked for five years.  
- **20%** (20,000 tokens) goes to the foundation for listing and big investments.  
- **70%** (70,000 tokens) is shared among miners.

## Miner Rewards Example (for an RTX 4090)

A miner with an RTX 4090 currently earns about **18.35 LooPIN tokens** per day. However, to get the full reward, miners need to meet two conditions:

### Proof of Time (PoT)
- New miners start by earning only **10%** of the full daily reward (**1.835 LooPIN**) on Day 1. The rest (**16.515 LooPIN**) is burned.  
- Each day, the reward increases slightly until **Day 30**, when miners reach the full **18.35 LooPIN reward** if they keep their machine running.  

### Proof of Loyalty (PoL)
- Miners are encouraged to hold their earned LooPIN tokens. If a miner has earned **100 LooPIN** but sells **10% (10 LooPIN)**, they are left with **90 LooPIN**.  
- Selling reduces their daily reward by **52%**, so they’ll only get **8.81 LooPIN** for the ongoing days, with the remaining **9.54 LooPIN** burned.

In short, the longer and more tokens miners hold, the more they can potentially earn.
