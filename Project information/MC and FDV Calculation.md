##### MC and FDV Calculation

##### MarketCap:

the formula is: **(current supply - 30%) * current price** 

**Block Fee Allocation**:

- **10% to the Team**: A small portion of block fees supports and incentivizes the core developers of the PinFi protocol.

- ##### 20% to Ecosystem Development

- **70% to GPU Miners**: The majority of block fees are  returned to the miners, rewarding their crucial role in infrastructure  support and network stability.

<u>for eg</u>: 
total supply = 1000 
30% of 1000 = 300 
then : (1000-300) * current price so -->  in this case:  700 * Price = MC 

or also: current supply x 0.7 x current price = MC

##### FDV :

73,000,000 (max supply) * Price = FDV
