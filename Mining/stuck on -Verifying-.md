If you have just added liquidity and notice that after 2 minutes you are still in "**Verifying**" it means there was an issue during the liquidity transfer. Please check if your wallet has been properly debited for the liquidity sent earlier. **If the liquidity has not been debited:**

- Delete your server using the "**Remove GPU**" button.



- Then, create a new server using the "**Deploy a new machine**" button.



- Finally, **add the liquidity** again.



-  **Verify if the liquidity has been debited** from your wallet. If it still hasnâ€™t been debited, restart this process from the beginning.
